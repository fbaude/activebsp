DESCRIPTION

C++ library implementing the BSP active object model on MPI.
Allows the creation of multi-process active objects by attaching MPI processes to a created active object.
The active objects communicate through method call and futures.
BSP active objects allow the parallel processing of requests through BSPlib.

This code uses BSPedupack 1.02, BSPonMPI v1.1, and Google Testing Framework,
which are all differently licensed. For that reason, they are not included in
this package and must be downloaded separately. The bootstrap.sh script will
automatically try to download them and patch them accordingly. If it does not
work, this should be done manually. See the bootstrap script on how to do that.

REQUIREMENTS

- CMake 3.13 or newer
- an MPI implementation
- Boost C++ Library 1.58 or newer (serialization, MPL)
- a pthread implementation
- libjpeg for the imgproc example (could be made optional)
